# Firewall Port Blocking - Telnet (Port 23)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Demonstrate how to block inbound traffic on a specific port (Port 23 used by Telnet), verify behavior with Wireshark, and summarize how a firewall filters traffic.

---

## ðŸ”§ Steps Performed

### 1. Create an Inbound Rule to Block Telnet Port 23 (Windows)

### âž¤ Using Command Prompt:
```run the command prompt as administrator :

    ````netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block Telnet Port 23" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=23```

### 2. Test the Rule 
    # Run a Python script that listens on port 23:

import socket

HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 23

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.bind((HOST, PORT))
    s.listen(1)
    print(f"[*] Listening for Telnet connections on port {PORT}...")
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    with conn:
        print(f"[+] Connected by {addr}")
        conn.sendall(b"Welcome to the fake Telnet server!\n")

### 3. Run the cmd from another command prompt
    prompt:
           telnet 127.0.0.1 23  

        [Before this you have to install Telnet via cmd running as administrator if not this will not work]

     command prompt :
                    dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient   
       
        [if you want to disable it you can by :Disable-Feature in the place of Enable-Feature]            

### 4. Monitor using Wireshark 
    # Filter Used :
                    tcp.port == 23
```You may not see packets if the rule is working correctly and dropping them ```

``` After the scan Remove the rule (Optional)
        cmd:
            netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block Telnet Port 23"

#### SUMMARY : HOW FIREWALL FILTERS TRAFFIC ####

   a. A firewall inspects incoming and outgoing  network packets.

   b. It applies rules based on criteria like:

        1.Direction: inbound (to your PC) or outbound (from your PC)

        2.Protocol: TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.

        3.Port numbers: source or destination ports (e.g., port 23 for Telnet)

        4.IP addresses: source or destination IP or IP ranges

        5.Profiles: Network profiles like Domain,Private, Public

   c. Packets matching a block rule are dropped (no network connection established).

   d. Packets matching an allow rule are permitted to pass through.

   e. If no matching rule is found, Windows Firewall uses default behavior (usually blocking inbound unsolicited traffic).

   f. Firewall rules can be ordered and prioritized; first match applies.

   g. Firewalls protect your system by preventing unwanted network access and controlling application traffic.
